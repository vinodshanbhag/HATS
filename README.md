# HATS
HATS is an implementation of clever and simple protocol that aims at providing high availability for cloud based key value stores by building resiliency against a single data center unavailability. While the protocol itself can be implemented for any key value store that provides an expected interface, this particular implementation targets Azure Table Storage.
